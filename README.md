## My process💭

This is a simple project that I started by marking out initial classes in the html file to be later used for styling. Next I began styling the css by styling the search bar and button. I then added functionality by way of JavaScript to toggle between classes when the user clicks on the button.

### Built with👷🏾‍♀️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned👩🏾‍🏫

I learned the logic behind making a simple hidden search bar. I will be applying this to future projects where needed.

### Continued development🔮

In the future I plan on continuing to practice positioning elements using flexbox, and using different selectors such as nth of type to select elements.

I also plan on continuing to practice using event listeners to make my pages more functional.

I also plan on continuing to learn the best ways to phrase git commits, so that future viewers can fully understand the changes that have occurred.


### Useful resources📖

- [Resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) - This is an amazing article which helped me write better commit messages. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
